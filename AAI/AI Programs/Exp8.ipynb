Introduction:\n","Bayesian learning is a probabilistic approach to reasoning under uncertainty, where knowledge about an event is updated as new evidence is observed. It is based on Bayes’ Theorem, which relates conditional and marginal probabilities of events.\n","\n","2. Bayes’ Theorem:\n","Bayes’ Theorem helps in computing the posterior probability P(H|E), i.e., the probability of hypothesis H given evidence E.\n","\n","3. Example (Wet Grass Problem):\n","We consider a scenario with three events: Rain, Sprinkler, and Wet Grass. Wet grass can result from either rain or the sprinkler being on. Given the grass is wet, we use Bayes’ Theorem to compute the probability it rained.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"QnZmjSD1E6dJ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## **Code & Output**"],"metadata":{"id":"1_cD50233TVe"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Define probabilities\n","P_rain = 0.2                    # P(Rain)\n","P_sprinkler_given_rain = 0.01  # P(Sprinkler|Rain)\n","P_sprinkler_given_no_rain = 0.4\n","P_wet_grass_given_rain_sprinkler = 0.99\n","P_wet_grass_given_rain_no_sprinkler = 0.9\n","P_wet_grass_given_no_rain_sprinkler = 0.8\n","P_wet_grass_given_no_rain_no_sprinkler = 0.0\n","\n","# Use total probability theorem to calculate P(WetGrass)\n","P_no_rain = 1 - P_rain\n","P_sprinkler_and_rain = P_rain * P_sprinkler_given_rain\n","P_no_sprinkler_and_rain = P_rain * (1 - P_sprinkler_given_rain)\n","P_sprinkler_and_no_rain = P_no_rain * P_sprinkler_given_no_rain\n","P_no_sprinkler_and_no_rain = P_no_rain * (1 - P_sprinkler_given_no_rain)\n","\n","# Total probability of wet grass\n","P_wet_grass = (\n","    P_sprinkler_and_rain * P_wet_grass_given_rain_sprinkler +\n","    P_no_sprinkler_and_rain * P_wet_grass_given_rain_no_sprinkler +\n","    P_sprinkler_and_no_rain * P_wet_grass_given_no_rain_sprinkler +\n","    P_no_sprinkler_and_no_rain * P_wet_grass_given_no_rain_no_sprinkler\n",")\n","\n","# Bayes Theorem: P(Rain | Wet Grass)\n","P_rain_and_wet_grass = (\n","    P_sprinkler_and_rain * P_wet_grass_given_rain_sprinkler +\n","    P_no_sprinkler_and_rain * P_wet_grass_given_rain_no_sprinkler\n",")\n","P_rain_given_wet_grass = P_rain_and_wet_grass / P_wet_grass\n","\n","print(f\"P(Wet Grass) = {P_wet_grass:.3f}\")\n","print(f\"P(Rain | Wet Grass) = {P_rain_given_wet_grass:.3f}\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"ecebuuo5E5sW","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1744799166519,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":3,"user":{"displayName":"Yash Agrawal","userId":"00981640824773720604"}},"outputId":"662c6ede-86a7-469d-b2e8-c26d656659a6"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["P(Wet Grass) = 0.436\n","P(Rain | Wet Grass) = 0.413\n"]}]}]}
