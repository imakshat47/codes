Variables and Data Types\n","Variables are used to store data values and are created when first assigned.\n","Python supports various data types like int, float, str, and bool.\n","\n","2. Operators\n","Operators are special symbols used to perform operations on variables and values.\n","Common operators include arithmetic (+, -), comparison (==, <) and logical (and, or).\n","\n","3. Control Flow\n","Control flow lets you execute code conditionally using if, elif, and else statements.\n","Loops (for, while) allow repeating a block of code multiple times based on conditions.\n","\n","4. Functions\n","Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task and can return results.\n","They are defined using the def keyword and can accept parameters.\n","\n","5. Data Structures\n","\n"," 5.1 List\n","Lists are ordered, mutable collections used to store multiple items in a single variable.\n","You can add, remove, or access elements using index positions.\n","\n"," 5.2 Tuple\n","Tuples are ordered and immutable collections, meaning their values cannot be changed.\n","They are useful for fixed data like coordinates or days of the week.\n","\n"," 5.3 Set\n","Sets are unordered collections of unique elements, useful for eliminating duplicates.\n","You can add or remove items, but indexing is not allowed.\n","\n"," 5.4 Dictionary\n","Dictionaries store data in key-value pairs, allowing fast lookups by key.\n","They are mutable and ideal for structured data like user profiles.\\"],"metadata":{"id":"pELnPCG9xjMw"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## **Code & Output**"],"metadata":{"id":"KcBfG5DVznzh"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"OrO14rRQxBlp","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1745384160115,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":76,"user":{"displayName":"Yash Agrawal","userId":"00981640824773720604"}},"outputId":"745d01f6-2bec-43fb-c9f9-420bbcf2d1f4"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["1.
