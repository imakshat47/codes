Breadth-First Search (BFS)**\n","\n","Definition: BFS is an uninformed search algorithm that explores all nodes at the current depth level before moving to the next level.\n","\n","Usage: It guarantees the shortest path in terms of the number of moves but doesn't consider the goal location during traversal.\n","\n","**Informed Search -
